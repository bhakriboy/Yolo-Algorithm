# Yolo-Algorithm
The following sets of code were used in the design of an intelligent algorithm to recognize and track the various objects with a bounding box. Furthermore they also predicted the corresponding grasp orientation in a live video stream. The key technique was based on the YOLO algorithm, which is a deep learning algorithm using several convolutional neural network (CNN) layers to process information from a live video. The algorithm was coded in Python by utilizing the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. In addition to this OpenCV was used for video and image processing.
